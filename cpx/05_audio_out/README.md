[CircuitPython Audio Out](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-audio-out)

There are two ways to get audio output, one is via the small built in speaker.
The other is by using alligator clips to connect a headphone or speaker to the
*A0* pin.

To connect a speaker or headphones, use two alligator clips and connect *GND* to
the sleeve of the headphone, and *A0* to the tip.
